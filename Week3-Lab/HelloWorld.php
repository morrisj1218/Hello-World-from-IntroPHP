  echo '<p>I am a student at TSTC. This is actually my second run at college. In 2010 I received a bachelor’s degree from Sam Houston State University in Criminal Justice. In 2012 I graduated valedictorian of my class at East Texas Police Academy in Kilgore. The following two and half years I served my community first as a police officer for the city of Marshall and later as a deputy for the Harrison County Sheriff’s Office. I left law enforcement completely in December 2014 for a plethora of reasons and began driving trucks under contract for various oil and gas service companies. Some here in the local area, but most kept me away from home for long periods of time.</p>';

  echo '<p>In 2018 one week after New Years, my wife and I split up. I was thankfully awarded primary custody of our two children, Ryder and Jack Ryan. Unable to go back to work in the oil and gas industry I decided it was time to make a change. After researching several different ideas of career path, I decided that TSTC in Marshall would be the best option and I would enroll for the Fall 2018 semester. I knew that I wanted to focus my studies on computers and IT. Not knowing which degree plan to choose specifically, Mrs. Hollingshead signed me up for Software Development. Going into the semester I was worried, at first. Mainly due to the fact that I had ZERO coding experience and my overall computer skills were really just a basic knowledge of Windows. Today, I am starting the third week of my second semester of Software Development and so far, I absolutely LOVE programming. I am so excited I have finally found a career field that I enjoy working in and I feel like I’ve actually accomplished something at the end of the day. I’m excited to be starting PHP this semester and look forward to learning absolutely all that I can from ‘Coach’ about PHP and web development overall.</p>';
